# Linky next

This branch serves as a complete overhaul of the code. Currently the app is very good PoC, but it lacks code that is easily manageable.
The goal of this rewrite is to create a codebase that can be maintained and owned.

TODO:

- [ ] Finish specification & scope
- [ ] Decide on code convention & libraries (effect, etc...)
- [ ] Decide on platform (web, vs react native)
